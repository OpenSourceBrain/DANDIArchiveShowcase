Scripts for interacting with the [DANDI Archive](https://www.dandiarchive.org/), particularly from [OSBv2](https://docs.opensourcebrain.org/OSBv2/Overview.html).
 For information about the NWB dandisets that is generated by the scripts in this repo, please visit [here](validation_folder/README.md).

## Installation Instructions

so please make sure they are installed and added to the system path. 
In addition, a local installation of NWB Explorer is advised for the purpose of testing files' compatibility with the app.
For details on NWBE's installation requirements and instructions, please visit [here]((https://github.com/MetaCell/nwb-explorer))

## Scripts information
- The nwb_table_readme.py script allows users to parse through all the dandisets in DANDIArchive, extract metadata information
and validate files in each dandiset against NWBInspector, as well as testing their compatibility with NWB Explorer. 
Validation reports and summary information are saved in a directory called validation_folder.
- The compatibility_test.py script works as a companion script to nwb_table_readme.py for the purpose of inspecting a file's compatibility with NWBE.
